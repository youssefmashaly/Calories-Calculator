# Calories-Calculator
This is a very nice Calorie Calculator I implemented during my online FreeCodeCamp JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures course which can calculate how many calories you have left in your daily budget  when you enter the calories that you consumed in breakfast, lunch , dinner, additional snacks and subtracting the excercise that you did.
